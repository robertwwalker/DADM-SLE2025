## Gemini from Willamette

Google gemini is a part of the educational workspaces that the university contracts from Google.  This gives us free access to gemini.  Let's see what it can do.

I know this task can be accomplished via Claude, let's ask Gemini....

::: {.callout-note}
## RWW

I need r code that will download Russian energy exports to the eu member states from Eurostar, all available time periods. Can you help?

## Gemini responds

This is a great task for the eurostat R package, which is specifically designed to download and work with data from the Eurostat database.

Since Eurostat measures imports of goods into the EU (which are Russia's exports to the EU), the relevant datasets will be for EU imports. The main energy import data sets are nrg_ti_oil (for oil) and nrg_ti_gas (for gas).

Here is the R code to download the imports of natural gas and oil/petroleum products from Russia to individual EU Member States for all available time periods.

```{r}

## Explanation
install.packages("eurostat"): You need this package to interact with the Eurostat database API.

library(eurostat) / library(dplyr) / library(tidyr): Loads the necessary packages. dplyr and tidyr are helpful for cleaning and manipulating the data frame once downloaded.

### Data Set Codes:

Natural Gas: The dataset code is nrg_ti_gas (Imports of natural gas by partner country).

The product code for Natural gas (Standard international energy product classification - SIEC) is G3000.

Oil & Petroleum Products: The dataset code is nrg_ti_oil (Imports of oil and petroleum products by partner country).

Key product codes used: O4000 (Crude oil) and O4400_TOT (Oil products).

Partner Code: The geopolitical entity code for Russia is RU.

get_eurostat(): This is the core function for downloading data.

id: Specifies the dataset code (e.g., "nrg_ti_gas").

filters: A list that narrows down the results. By setting partner = "RU", we only get imports from Russia. We also filter by the specific siec (energy product) codes.

time_format = "date": Converts the Eurostat time column into an R date format.

type = "code": Ensures you get the raw dimension codes (geo, unit, siec, etc.), which is crucial for later labelling.

Data Cleaning & Combining: The downloaded data is cleaned, relevant columns are selected, and the two energy data frames are combined using bind_rows().

### Labelling:

get_eurostat_dic("geo", ...) is used to download a dictionary that maps the cryptic country codes (like DE, FR) to their full names (like Germany, France).

left_join() merges these full country names into your final dataset.

Final Filter: The last filter() step removes aggregate codes like EU27_2020 or non-EU countries, focusing the results on individual EU Member States.

## RWW

There is no variable code returned by get_eurostat_dic. can you fix this?
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Gemini responds:

You're right! The get_eurostat_dic function returns a data frame where the relevant columns for the code and label are named code and label, respectively, not code and label. I apologize for the error in my previous example. The column names need to be correctly referenced and then renamed for joining.

Here is the corrected R code. I have updated the line that fetches and renames the dictionary columns.

## Gemini says
The specific line that addresses your issue is:

```
geo_labels <- get_eurostat_dic("geo", lang = "en") %>%
  rename(geo_code = code, country_name = label)
```

By using rename(geo_code = code, country_name = label), we correctly reference the actual column names in the dictionary (code and label) and rename them to match the column in your main data (geo_code).

::: {.callout-note}
## RWW

That was also incorrect. It seems that get_eurostat_dic returns code_name and full_name. Can you make the necessary change
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Gemini responds:

You're right, the column names returned by get_eurostat_dic() can sometimes vary depending on the version or the specific dictionary being called. When downloading the table of contents or dictionaries, the column names often appear as code_name and full_name. My apologies for the repeated error.

Here is the fully corrected R code using code_name and full_name for the dictionary columns.

## Gemini continues:

The key change is in the line where the dictionary is loaded and renamed:

R

```
geo_labels <- get_eurostat_dic("geo", lang = "en") %>%
  rename(geo_code = **code_name**, country_name = **full_name**) 
```

This correctly maps the columns from the dictionary to the column names used in your main energy data, ensuring the left_join() operation works as intended.

::: {.callout-note}
## RWW

This works.

It suggested other things I might wish to do.



::: {.callout-note}
## RWW:
How can I visualize this data in R?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Gemini responds:

The best way to visualize this data is by using the ggplot2 package, which is the standard for high-quality graphics in R. You can show the shift in imports over time for different countries and energy types.

Here is the R code to create a clear visualization using the final_data_russia_imports data frame you generated, along with a few common and insightful plot types.

1. Prepare Data for Visualization
Before plotting, it's often helpful to load the plotting library and make a slight modification to ensure the time variable is handled correctly for plotting.


```{r}
#| error: true
# Install ggplot2 if you haven't already
# install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)

# Ensure the 'time' column is a proper date object (it should be if you used time_format = "date")
final_data_russia_imports <- final_data_russia_imports %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(time))
  
# OPTIONAL: Sum annual values for a cleaner annual view (as the source data is annual)
# If you are using monthly data (nrg_ti_oilm), you'll want to keep the month for granular plotting
annual_summary <- final_data_russia_imports %>%
  group_by(country_name, year, product, unit_code) %>%
  summarise(total_value = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
```

2. Visualization Code
A. Total Energy Imports Over Time (Stacked Area Chart)
This plot is excellent for showing how a country's total reliance on Russian energy changes over time and how the mix of Oil vs. Gas contributes to that total.

```{r}
# Plot 1: Stacked Area Chart for Selected Countries
# Filter for 4-5 major importers for a clean, readable visual
top_importers <- annual_summary %>%
  filter(year == max(annual_summary$year)) %>% 
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(annual_total = sum(total_value)) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = annual_total, n = 5) %>%
  pull(country_name)

ggplot(annual_summary %>% filter(country_name %in% top_importers), 
       aes(x = year, y = total_value, fill = product)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, position = "stack") +
  # Use a facet wrap to create a separate chart for each country
  facet_wrap(~ country_name, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Crude Oil" = "#0072B2", "Natural Gas" = "#D55E00", "Oil Products" = "#CC79A7")) +
  labs(
    title = "Annual Russian Energy Imports by Top EU Member States",
    subtitle = "Volume of Crude Oil, Oil Products, and Natural Gas Imports Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = paste0("Total Import Value (in ", unique(annual_summary$unit_code)[1], " or equivalent)"), # Use the actual unit from the data
    fill = "Energy Product"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

B. Change in Imports (Lollipop or Dumbbell Chart)
To highlight the change from a pre-war baseline (e.g., 2021) to the latest available year, a lollipop chart is very effective.

```{r}
#| error: true
# Plot 2: Change in Natural Gas Imports (2021 vs. Latest Year)
# Note: You may need to adjust the years based on your dataset's coverage
gas_change <- annual_summary %>%
  filter(product == "Natural Gas" & year %in% c(2021, max(annual_summary$year))) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = total_value, names_prefix = "Y_") %>%
  # Calculate the percentage change and filter out NA values
  mutate(
    change_pct = (Y_2025 - Y_2021) / Y_2021,
    country_name = reorder(country_name, Y_2025 - Y_2021) # Sort by change
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Y_2021) & !is.na(Y_2025)) 

ggplot(gas_change, aes(x = country_name)) +
  # Line segment for the lollipop stick (Dumbbell plot variant is similar)
  geom_segment(aes(xend = country_name, y = Y_2021, yend = Y_2025), color = "grey") +
  # Dot for the starting point (2021)
  geom_point(aes(y = Y_2021), color = "#0072B2", size = 3) +
  # Dot for the end point (Latest Year)
  geom_point(aes(y = Y_2025), color = "#D55E00", size = 3) +
  
  # Flip coordinates for better country name readability
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = paste0("Shift in Russian Natural Gas Imports: 2021 vs. ", max(gas_change$year)),
    subtitle = "Blue dots represent 2021 volume; Orange dots represent the latest volume.",
    x = "EU Member State",
    y = "Natural Gas Import Volume"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

C. Import Share by Country (Bar Chart)
A simple bar chart can show the distribution of a single year's total imports across all member states.

```{r Plot3}
#| error: true
# Plot 3: Bar Chart of Total Russian Energy Imports for the Latest Year
latest_year_data <- annual_summary %>%
  filter(year == max(annual_summary$year)) %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(annual_total = sum(total_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # Filter out countries with zero imports for a cleaner chart
  filter(annual_total > 0) %>%
  mutate(country_name = reorder(country_name, annual_total))

ggplot(latest_year_data, aes(x = country_name, y = annual_total)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  # Add value labels
  geom_text(aes(label = round(annual_total, 0)), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  # Flip coordinates
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = paste("Russian Energy Import Volume by EU Country:", max(latest_year_data$year)),
    subtitle = "Total volume of crude oil, oil products, and natural gas imports.",
    x = "EU Member State",
    y = paste0("Total Import Volume (in ", unique(annual_summary$unit_code)[1], " or equivalent)")
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
